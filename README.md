# DIY_Britain_COVID_19_Dashboard_React_FastAPI_Version

This is a dashboard to display three sets of COVID-19 data, from Public Health England's Open Data API (see: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/developers-guide/main-api).

It is a refactoring of https://github.com/CJoubertLocal/DIY_Britain_COVID_19_Dashboard. The previous version used created the dashboard with Jupyter Notebooks, Binder, and Viola. This version instead uses React and FastAPI.
