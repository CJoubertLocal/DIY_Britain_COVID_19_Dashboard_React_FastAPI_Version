    The first vaccination in Britain was given on 8 December 2020, to Margaret Keenan, a patient at the NHS (Source). This was the Pfizer-BioTech vaccine and marked the start of Britain&apos;s vaccination campaign. Vaccinations were initially provided to the most vulnerable (the elderly and those with weakened immune systems), starting with persons aged over 80 years old (Source).

   The types of vaccinations included viral vector vaccines produced by Oxford-AstraZeneca (which achieved an efficacy rate of 72% according to the WHO (Source)) and Johnson and Johnson (Source). The COVID-19 pandemic further saw the first mass production of mRNA technology to vaccine production, with the introduction of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.

    Over eighty percent of the populations of England, Wales and Scotland had recevied at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccination by mid-2021. In the wake of new covid varients, further booster vaccinations were recommended. By late 2022, approximately 70% of the populations of each of these nations had received three vaccinations. Up until December 2022, 100% vaccination had not been achieved, and some five percent of the population in each region had only received the first vaccination.
