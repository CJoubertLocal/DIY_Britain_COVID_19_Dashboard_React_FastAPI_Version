  Transmission Rates
</h3>
<p>
  The first positive tests for COVID-19 were recorded in late January 2020 (<a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51325192'>Source</a>). Over the following years, the nations of England, Scotland and Wales introduced multiple legal restrictions on movement (&apos;lockdowns&apos;), with the purpose of limiting the spread of the virus. The first lockdown was formally declared on the 23rd March 2020 (<a href='https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/charts/uk-government-coronavirus-lockdowns'>Source</a>).
</p>
<p>
  The transmission of the virus was recorded with a reproduction number (&apos;R value&apos;), which summarised how many additional infections were expected for each infection that occurred. For example, with an R value of 2, if one person is infected, two additional people would be expected to become infected too (resulting in three total infections, before considering additional infections beyond that) (<a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52473523'>Source</a>).

  The below chart details the percentage change in the number of infections from one day to the next.
