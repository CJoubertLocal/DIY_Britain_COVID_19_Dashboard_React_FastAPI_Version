<h3>
    Cumulative Deaths
  </h3>
  <p>
    There two two major peaks of COVID-19 deaths in the United Kingdom, on a seven-day moving average. The first was 9 April 2020, when approximately 975 people were dying each day. The second was on 19 January 2021, when approximately 1,291 people died each day. (<a href='https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths'>Source</a>) These numbers may be undercounting the total number of deaths, as they only include those who tested positive for COVID-19 within 28 days of their deaths.

    Across most UTLA regions, there was a large spike in the cumulative number of deaths at the beginning of 2021, corresponding with the second major spike in the death rate.
